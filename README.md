When you pull code on your machine, just open it via Intellij. When project is opened, you will find two tests, in folder target/test=classes, CreateProject and CreateReport.
CreateProject is everything about playground tab. Creating, maintaining, editing, deleting project.
CreateReport is about creating report.
